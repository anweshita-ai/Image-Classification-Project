# Image-Classification-Project
# **Project Overview**
This is my Image Classification project where I trained a deep learning model to recognize and classify images.
I used Google Colab for coding and TensorFlow/Keras for building the model.

# **Project Contents**
Image_Classification_Notebook.ipynb – Complete Colab notebook
model_weights.h5 – Trained model weights
preprocessing.py – Data loading & preprocessing
train.py – Model training
evaluate.py – Model testing
visualize.py – Graphs & result plots
Visualizations – Accuracy curve, confusion matrix, ROC curve, sample predictions

How to Run
Open the Colab notebook or clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the scripts in order:
preprocessing.py → train.py → evaluate.py → visualize.py

Results
Test Accuracy: almost 80%
Model performs well on most images
Visualizations show predictions and performance

Model Info
CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Dropout
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
